# global-covid19-analysis

Developed this project under the guidance of Mr. Vikas Bajpai. The project aims at predicting the covid graph worldwide. The graph seemed to be 92% accurate for confirmed, active , recovered and death cases. The trend of china has been excluded in the analysis because of the uneven trend it showed in the raph. All other countries have been taken into consideration.
